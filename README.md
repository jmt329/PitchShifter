# Introduction

We designed a real-time pitch shifter on the DE1-SoC FPGA that was controlled by the ARM core using a GUI. The motivation for this project stemmed from the fact that the large amount of processing power available on the FPGA is well suited to audio input and output streaming, along with the required intermediate processing. As a result, we decided to utilize these capabilities to design and implement a real-time pitch shifter that could perform the following tasks: pitch-shift the left and right audio outputs independently with manual pitch tuning, produce voice chords using the right and left audio outputs along with the original voice, and produce time-variant pitch shifting by modulating the appropriate parameters at varying rates. The final product is able to produce many different voice effects, all while being controlled from a simple, user-friendly GUI displayed on a VGA monitor.
